            I definitely agree on the 4-1-4-1 formation.
        </h2>

        <div class="cbody">
          <p>We definitely unlocked a lot of defenses in those string of games last season. (With the midfield three of Fellaini, Carrick and Herrera) For some reason those three truly balanced each other out because they all had three different roles that somehow worked out so well. With our current squad, I would love to see a midfield trio of Schneiderlin, Herrera/Mata, and rotate Carrick/Schweinsteiger (whoever is more fit) as the single pivot.</p>

          I think given our current roster make up the formation switch would probably be more effective.
        </h2>

        <div class="cbody">
          <p>We have been praising our defense, and I’ve been gloating about Schneiderlin the whole season, how about we stop bang them with the double pivot and see how good they really are. And I think Schndeiderlin and Smalling would definitely be up to the task. Also Schneiderlin would have to be the pivot in that formation, in order to he can do his job of shielding the defense.</p>
          <p>If not that, I wish van Gaal would at least try playing Herrera alongside Scheiderlin in the double pivot,</p>

        I think United would be better with a 4-1-4-1/4-3-3
      </h2>

      <div class="cbody">
        <p>That formation coincided with the best run of form the club had last season, and there are upgrades for some of the positions in that system now.  Schweinsteiger is an upgrade on Fellaini in a lot of areas, and the two could rotate in the left CM spot depending on the needs of the game and the opposition.  Schniederlin is arguably an upgrade on Carrick in that formation due to his much better defense, and if Schweinsteiger is starting you don’t miss Carrick’s creativity like you would if Fellaini started.  Martial is also an upgrade on Rooney in the striker spot.  Young could reprise his role on the left hand side, and Mata would play on the right so he can link up with Herrera and Darmian/Valencia like they did last season.  The only problem with this formation is that Rooney doesn’t have a place in it.  Most fans would agree that Rooney should be dropped/rested for a while, but it seems to be much tougher convincing the manager and the club to do it.</p>

        generally reasonable stuff
      </h2>

        <p>Though:</p>
        <blockquote>The kindest among us would describe Louis van Gaal’s side as "solid" or even "dull."</blockquote>
        <p>No, the kindest of us would describe them as "talented and grimly effective".</p>
        <p>And the No 10 spot might get a bit crowded if we have Mata and Herrera both play there.</p>

        A 4141 formation with this lineup:
      </h2>
      <div class="cbody">
        <p><span class="caps">DDG</span><br>
          Darmian Smalling Blind Rojo<br>
          Schneiderlin<br>
          Mata Herrera Rooney(1) Memphis(2)<br>
          Martial</p>
          <p>It could be worth a shot.<br>
          (1) Schweinsteiger would be a better alternative at the moment.<br>
          (2) Young if Memphis is still out of form.</p>
          <p>But ultimately, I think the 4231 formation fits our current squad better. We have many defensive minded CMs (5 if you include Fellaini and Blind) and many CAMs (Lingard, Mata, Pereira, Herrera). We only have two real wingers in Young and Memphis. We should stick with the attacking midfield 3 which would accomodate our CAMs more.<br>
          Besides, there is too much quality in CM to reduce the number of spots in that position to just one starter.</p>

        I think a bit of tactical flexibility would be a breath of fresh air
      </h2>

      <div class="cbody">
        <p>We don’t necessarily have to change our base formation but changes for ‘situations’ should be standard practice. <span class="caps">LVG</span> is reluctant to chase games and everyone at United keeps moaning "they we’re sitting deep theres, nothing we could do… errr? errm philosophy and stuff yeh. "</p>
        <p>Rather then fully commiting yourself to this ridged pragmatism. Surely it’s more logical to take some bloody risks. Next time an opposition sits deep make the changes, that’s what subs are for. 4-1-4-1,  4-4-3, 4-4-2 are all dynamic attacking formations that can open up even the most stubborn, deepest and most drilled defences. We’re too predictable for a team that’s Relying on one man for goals.</p>

        Well said JG
      </h2>
      <div class="cbody">
        <p>I remember a time that when a team came to OT to just defend it was music to our ears, we’d wear them down, passing well, switching flank to flank, runners from midfield &amp; wide until invariably we’d stick 3 – 4 past them. Now our team lacks balls, daring do, &amp; are too cautious, we need the old United back!!</p>

          <p>Oh Leicester 5-3, oh god, let’s never attack again eh? During the glory days I remember results like 6-3 loss at Southampton, 5-0 loss at Newcastle, 3-1 loss at home to Fulham etc,did our balls fall off &amp; we turn into a boring negative side? No. I also can recall results like 3-0 down to a 5-3 win at Spurs, 8-1 away to Forest, 9-0 at home to Ipswich, I could go on… The fact is one game doesn’t define United or an entire season, and the other depressing fact is that we’re unduly cautious &amp; imo won’t play good football til our idiot manager is sacked.</p>

          <p>I’ve only seen Rafa’s Madrid using it. It seems like a dying formation nowadays, because 4-2-3-1 is the new 4-4-2.</p>

          This might come off as dumb but...
        </h2>

        <div class="cbody">
          <p>Would a 4-3-3 be a solution to unlock defenses in a 4-2-3-1? With three forwards up front, it’s also really good on the counter-attack, I’m taking it as well? 4-1-4-1 looks even like a modified 4-3-3, and I often mistaken it as well.</p>

          I think switching to 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 is worth a try
        </h2>
        <div class="cbody">
          <p>It allows for more men further forward, and I guess in essence they are a modified version of each other, as in the 4-1-4-1  the flanks are bushed back further and are midfielders instead of forwards.</p>
          <p>I am a fan of the 4-3-3, single pivot variation.  Just look at the great "possession" teams of Pep, he has mostly employed the 4-3-3 at Barcelona along with Munich, and the Del Bosque uses the 4-3-3 as well for his possession game.</p>
          <p>Hopefully the formation switch would open up more space and allow for more movement. Because that’s what will make the "possession" game more effective, movement and quicker passing.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="cbody">
          <p>His main attacking strength is his ability to make runs from deep, and that can get a little blunted when he’s too far forward. Better to play him deeper, in a midfield two with a more defensive player – Schneiderlin being the obvious choice.</p>
